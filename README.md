# Crypto_Worksheet
This cute little worksheet lets you manually encrypt short messages with unbreakable one-time-pad.

Here is a slightly tongue-in-cheek answer to the question of how to stop people from intercepting and reading your data... a compact worksheet that lets a user employ unbreakable encryption on trusty un-hackable paper!

Enjoy - And make sure you use a real coin on a real cement floor to generate random binary keys!
